## About 
Draws the trajectory of standard projectiles for the game ShellShock Live on top of the game. 

![Here is how the application looks.](https://github.com/MathisSchm/ShellShockDrawer/blob/master/ShellShockProjectileMotion/formWindowPreview.png)

### How to use: 
- Input your angle or set it to whatever you like between 1 and 89. 
- Press the "Set Position" button. 
- Middle click to set the two positions.

Use currently up to 1 bumper: 
- Press "Bumper Mode". 
- Press the "Set Position" button.
- Middle click to set the two positions. 
- Press "Mark Bumper". 
- Middle click on left and right end of the bumper to mark it. 

(Optional: Drag the circle in bumper mode to adjust the range by which you're willing to miss the shot. A larger range means a higher possibility that the target area is reachable from your current player position.)

_Notes_
* Cannot calculate wind. Intended for use in single player games only. 
* Bumper arc may varies from the ingame one, but the projectile should land pretty close nonetheless. 

TODO: Clean up.
